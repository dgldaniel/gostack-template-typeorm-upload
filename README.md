# Typeorm upload

Stores incoming and outcoming financial transactions and allows the registration and listing of these transactions, in addition to allowing the creation of new records in the database by sending a csv file.

## Requirements

- For development, you will need Node.js, a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

- Docker to use PostgresSQL.

- Insomnia to use API REST.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

### Main Tools and concepts

- Typescript
- Express.js
- TypeORM
- Eslint
- Jest

### Yarn installation

After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.

      $ npm install -g yarn

### Postgres installation

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

After installing, run this command on the terminal:

      $ docker run --name <some-name> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p <some-port>:5432 -d postgres
      
If the container is not running, start the service:
  
      $ docker start <container-name>
      
## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/dgldaniel/typeorm-upload.git
    $ cd typeorm-upload
    $ yarn install
      
## Configure app

Create "gostack_desafio06" and "gostack_desafio06_tests" database using some Postgres service (PostBird, Pgadmin...)

Check that the database credentials in the file are correct in 'ormconfig.json'.

With the Postgre service turned on, migrate with the command:

    $ yarn typeorm migration:run
 
## Running the project

In other terminal, run:

    $ yarn dev:server
    

### Create a transaction - **`POST /transactions`**:
 
Request example:

```json
{
	"title": "Patinete El√©trico",
	"value": 1, 
	"type": "income",
	"category": "Radical"
}
```

### List transactions - **`GET /transactions`**:
 
### Delete a transaction - **`DELETE /transactions/:id`**:

### Import a file csv - **`POST /transactions`**:

Use file.csv on root directory and import using Multipart with "file" key

## Running tests

Select "gostack_desafio06_tests" on "ormconfig.json" and run migrations:

    $ yarn typeorm migration:run

    $ yarn test
